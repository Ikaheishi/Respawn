## Welcome
Project Respawn is a place to meet up and chat with people about the Splatoon
and Pokémon series along with other stuff, including—but not limited to—Art,
Music, Gaming, Photography, and Super Smash Bros. Players of all ages, walks of
life, and skill levels are welcome.

We usually have online Splatoon meetups every Saturday or Sunday, sometime
between 12:30 PM and 7:30 PM Pacific (8:30p-3:30a GMT/BST) (except during
Splatfests). However, you're more than welcome to set up your own private
battle, squad, and league sessions with other people at anytime you like.

This site is currently under construction, but we invite you to
[come join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/e9JqEcx)
and hang out with us.

On our Discord server, we have special alert roles that you can join to opt-in
to getting pings for each individual game, replacing how @here/@everyone tend
to be used in some other communities. Anybody can mention these roles if
they're looking to play. You can join/leave an alert role anytime though bot
commands.

There is no obligation whatsoever to use the voice channels. There are voice
chats on the server, but plenty of our members prefer not to use it.
